1st June 2022:

Changelog from Blackmore pre-publication release 17th April 2020. 
NOTE: A number of changes have been made to calculate.py which may break compatibility with the old version. 

- Removed capitalisation from module names to match other Python functions. 

- Attempted to unify capitalisation across function names and variables. Capitalisation left for quantum numbers e.g. N, MN, I1... and in the names of the molecules. 

- Moved molecular constants into dedicated diatom.calculate module. The names for each dictionary have been changed to include the atomic mass of both species in a consistent way, e.g. Rb87Cs133 and K40Rb87.

- Added molecular constants for K40Rb87. Na23K40, and Na23Rb87, citations give in module. 

- Added "magnetic_moment" function to calculate magnetic moments of molecular states. 

- Added "sort_by_state" function to sort states by (N, MF)_k. 

- Removed all references to pyprind from calculate.py (was previously used in the sort_smooth function) to help compatibility and simplify installation. 

- Moved export_energy and export_state_comp to plotting.py. Using this module as a good place for bits of code that are in progress or not explicitly needed in current workflows. 

- Bug fix in transition_dipole_moment (formerly TDM) function that avoids having to transpose array on input. 




8th June 2022:
- Added function for calculating the lab-frame electric dipole moment. 

- Added example script for calculating the lab-frame electric dipole moments.
