Welcome to Diatomic-py's documentation!
=======================================
Diatomic-py is a python module for computing the interaction between the hyperfine structure of a simple diatomic molecule and external fields.

Features
--------

Diatomic-py is a very flexible program, and can currently perform the following calculations for <sup>1</sup>Σ ground states:

 * AC and DC Stark maps
 * Breit-Rabi diagrams
 * Hyperfine state compositions

Through fundamental representations of the hyperfine structure many more effects can be observed by combining diatomic-py with numpy and scipy.

Coming Soon
-----------

 * Plotting functionality
 * Fitting of experimental data
 * Doublet-sigma molecules

Installation
------------
Install diatomic-py by downloading the .whl file from GitHub and running:
    ``pip install diatomic-py.whl``

on windows use:
    ``python -m pip install diatomic-py.whl``

Usage
-----

Typical usage of this module requires the user-facing calculate module.
    ``from diatom import calculate``
or
    ``import diatom.calculate as calculate``


An example calculations are shown in the python scripts on `GitHub`_.

Access to all of the individual terms is available through the hamiltonian module
    ``from diatom import hamiltonian``
